Revision history for Perl extension Class::Observable.

1.00  Fri May  2 09:58:57 EDT 2003

      - Add copy_observers() so you can copy observers from one
      observed item to another.

      - We're stable enough to be a version 1.x!

0.03  Mon Aug 19 23:02:13 EDT 2002

      - Be able to turn debugging on and off programmatically via
      SET_DEBUG()

      - Allow any number of paramters sent via notify_observers(). (This is
      Perl, after all...). This is a very small API change and fully
      backward compatible.


0.02  Tue May 28 09:25:12 EDT 2002

      - Modified API to be more like java.util.Observable:

          remove_observer( $o )  -> delete_observer( $o )
          remove_all_observers() -> delete_observers()
                                 -> count_observers()

        Updated docs and tests accordingly.


0.01  Sun May 26 14:02:30 EDT 2002

      Initial version -- it's got tests! It's got documentation!
